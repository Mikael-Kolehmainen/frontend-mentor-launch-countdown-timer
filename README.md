<h2>About</h2>
<p style='font-size: 16px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;'>
  This is my foundation for all my React web projects. It's written in TypeScript
  and also includes the backend in the same application for simplicity. I have
  also added comments to the code. Prettier is configured to work in this application.
  This README file also serves as a template for my other projects.

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p style='font-size: 16px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;'>
  When I start a new React project, I copy these files which gives the project a nice
  structure and efficienncy when starting a new project. Then I'll install the packages
  and start it up. Then I can easily start working on the project with a clean and
  familiar structure that I enjoy using.
